**Blameless Culture Reminder:**

This post-mortem follows a blameless culture approach. The focus is on:
- Understanding what happened
- Identifying systemic issues
- Improving processes and systems
- Learning and growing as a team

Individuals are not blamed for incidents. We acknowledge that:
- Systems are complex
- Humans make mistakes
- Our goal is to make it easier to do the right thing
- We learn more from understanding than from blame
